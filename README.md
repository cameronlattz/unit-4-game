This is an RPG-style game using Star Wars characters. You first choose a character to play as, then you choose another 
character to fight against. From there, click "Attack!" to start the fight. You win a round when the defender's health runs 
down to 0. If your health goes down to 0, you lose.

Each character has a different amount of health. After winning a fight, a character gets stronger and gains 10 health for 
the next fight. The game is over when there are no enemies remaining.
